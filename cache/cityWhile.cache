// Use two while loops. 
// Get as many cities from the user as they want - stop getting cities when the user says to stop. 
// The user can use any case mixture in their input (eg. SAN FranciSCO)
// Cities go into an array named 'cities'.  
// When city input is done, use a while loop that outputs to the console each city on its' own line in all lower case.
/* The output must be in this format:
eg. say the user inputs "OmaHa" and "St. LOUIS"
The output would look like this:
omaha
st. louis */
